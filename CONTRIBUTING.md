## How to Contribute to Feedmereadmes

Contributing to this project is pretty simple, because it's all about documentation. 

### Contributing to the Feedmereadmes Repository
- **Major change** (paragraph or more): Just open an Issue in the Issues Tracker that includes your idea, and wait for the maintainers to respond (24-72 hours). Once they approve your idea, go forth.
- **Minor change** (fixing typos, for example): Go ahead and make a pull request.

### Contributing to a Project Submitted to Feedmereadmes
You must respect the contribution guidelines established by the project you want to help. Usually, they include a CONTRIBUTING.md/.rst file like this one. The creators of Feedmereadmes won't be able to negotiate changes with projects for you; we are highly unlikely to know the project creators, and respect the decisions made by other project creators when it comes to how they want to manage their work. If a project's contributing requirements are higher-friction than you would like, no problem! Choose to help another project with simpler requirements. :)
